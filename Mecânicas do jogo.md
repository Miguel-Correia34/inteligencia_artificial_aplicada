- m* n grid
- scoring system
	- 100 points and decreases with each detection
	- **Grid Size Impact:** Let the grid be m×n, so the total number of cells is m⋅n.
	- **Penalty per Detection:** The penalty for each detection is 100m⋅n\frac{100}{m \cdot n}m⋅n100​. Each detection subtracts this amount from the current score.
- detect mode 
	- Signal Strength Probability - use the probability tables provided in the project document to assign signal strengths based on the distance d from treasure
		- d=0. Strong signals like + + + + most likely
		- d >= 3. Weak signals like + are most likely
	- Update probabilities: After each detection, update the probability for every cell on the grid to reflect the new information
		- Bayesian approach: update the probability for each cell based on the detected signal and its distance from the treasure.
	- pseudo-code
		- function detect(cell):
			- distance = calculate_distance(cell, treasure_position)
			- signal = generate_signal(distance, probability_table)
			- update_grid_probabilities(signal, cell, grid)
			- score -= 100/ (grid_rows * grid_cols)
			- return signal, score
